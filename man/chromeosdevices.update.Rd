\item{cpuStatusReports}{Reports of CPU utilization and temperature (Read-only)}

\item{ethernetMacAddress0}{(Read-only) MAC address used by the Chromebookâ€™s internal ethernet port, and for onboard network (ethernet) interface. The format is twelve (12) hexadecimal digits without any delimiter (uppercase letters). This is only relevant for some devices.}

\item{bootMode}{The boot mode for the device. The possible values are: * \code{Verified}: The device is running a valid version of the Chrome OS. * \code{Dev}: The devices's developer hardware switch is enabled. When booted, the device has a command line shell. For an example of a developer switch, see the \href{https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/samsung-series-5-chromebook#TOC-Developer-switch}{Chromebook developer information}.}

\item{status}{The status of the device.}

\item{willAutoRenew}{Determines if the device will auto renew its support after the support end date. This is a read-only property.}

\item{orgUnitPath}{The full parent path with the organizational unit's name associated with the device. Path names are case insensitive. If the parent organizational unit is the top-level organization, it is represented as a forward slash, \code{/}. This property can be \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-chrome-devices#update_chrome_device}{updated} using the API. For more information about how to create an organizational structure for your device, see the \href{https://support.google.com/a/answer/182433}{administration help center}.}

\item{firmwareVersion}{The Chrome device's firmware version.}

\item{activeTimeRanges}{List of active time ranges (Read-only).}

\item{annotatedUser}{The user of the device as noted by the administrator. Maximum length is 100 characters. Empty values are allowed.}

\item{recentUsers}{List of recent device users, in descending order, by last login time.}

\item{orderNumber}{The device's order number. Only devices directly purchased from Google have an order number.}

\item{systemRamFreeReports}{Reports of amounts of available RAM memory (Read-only)}

\item{meid}{The Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) or the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) for the 3G mobile card in a mobile device. A MEID/IMEI is typically used when adding a device to a wireless carrier's post-pay service plan. If the device does not have this information, this property is not included in the response. For more information on how to export a MEID/IMEI list, see the \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-chrome-devices.html#export_meid}{Developer's Guide}.}

\item{kind}{The type of resource. For the Chromeosdevices resource, the value is \code{admin#directory#chromeosdevice}.}

\item{osVersion}{The Chrome device's operating system version.}

\item{annotatedLocation}{The address or location of the device as noted by the administrator. Maximum length is \code{200} characters. Empty values are allowed.}

\item{autoUpdateExpiration}{(Read-only) The timestamp after which the device will stop receiving Chrome updates or support}

\item{lastKnownNetwork}{Contains last known network (Read-only)}

\item{dockMacAddress}{(Read-only) Built-in MAC address for the docking station that the device connected to. Factory sets Media access control address (MAC address) assigned for use by a dock. It is reserved specifically for MAC pass through device policy. The format is twelve (12) hexadecimal digits without any delimiter (uppercase letters). This is only relevant for some devices.}
