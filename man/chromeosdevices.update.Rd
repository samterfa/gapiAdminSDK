\item{model}{The device's model information. If the device does not have this information, this property is not included in the response.}

\item{supportEndDate}{Final date the device will be supported (Read-only)}

\item{ethernetMacAddress0}{(Read-only) MAC address used by the Chromebookâ€™s internal ethernet port, and for onboard network (ethernet) interface. The format is twelve (12) hexadecimal digits without any delimiter (uppercase letters). This is only relevant for some devices.}

\item{notes}{Notes about this device added by the administrator. This property can be \href{https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1698333}{searched} with the \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/chromeosdevices/list}{list} method's \code{query} parameter. Maximum length is 500 characters. Empty values are allowed.}

\item{serialNumber}{The Chrome device serial number entered when the device was enabled. This value is the same as the Admin console's \emph{Serial Number} in the \emph{Chrome OS Devices} tab.}

\item{diskVolumeReports}{Reports of disk space and other info about mounted/connected volumes.}

\item{cpuStatusReports}{Reports of CPU utilization and temperature (Read-only)}

\item{bootMode}{The boot mode for the device. The possible values are: * \code{Verified}: The device is running a valid version of the Chrome OS. * \code{Dev}: The devices's developer hardware switch is enabled. When booted, the device has a command line shell. For an example of a developer switch, see the \href{https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/samsung-series-5-chromebook#TOC-Developer-switch}{Chromebook developer information}.}

\item{orgUnitPath}{The full parent path with the organizational unit's name associated with the device. Path names are case insensitive. If the parent organizational unit is the top-level organization, it is represented as a forward slash, \code{/}. This property can be \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-chrome-devices#update_chrome_device}{updated} using the API. For more information about how to create an organizational structure for your device, see the \href{https://support.google.com/a/answer/182433}{administration help center}.}
